Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It provides tools and techniques to make sense of data, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions. Statistics is used across various fields such as business, finance, healthcare, social sciences, and more.

There are two main branches of statistics:

### 1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Focuses on summarizing and describing the features of a dataset.  
   - Common techniques include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation).  
   - Example: "The average height of students in a class is 5.6 feet."

### 2. **Inferential Statistics**  
   - Involves making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.  
   - Uses probability theory and techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.  
   - Example: "Based on a survey of 100 people, we predict that 60% of the population prefers coffee over tea."

Statistics is essential for decision-making, solving real-world problems, and discovering trends and relationships in data.
